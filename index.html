title: "NOTES about a human named Lauren Hyoseo Yoon"

Every single moment, we make choices. However, how do we actually make decisions? What is our thought process behind the actual decision and action? More essentially, how are perspectives molded? These questions about human cognition have always piqued my curiosity, pushing me to explore the neuroscience, cognitive science, and mathematics as I approach with computational eyes. 
These interests have further widened my research towards AI/ML, studying and developing the algorithms behind neural networks leveraging with the actual neural circuitry of brains (with animal models or humans). In this journey, Iâ€™m currently a rising junior at Northwestern University double majoring in Mathematics and Neuroscience (with a concentration in Computation & Systems Modeling).
